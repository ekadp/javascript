But in comment, I will use English to explain things for you.

Everyone in the world, in any country, can learn from this example.

What purpose will you get from learning from this example? You will 
understand that a simple example how to use Document Object Model (DOM), 
and also you can understand that using just DOM you can even create
a simple animation.

It is just a string that would be animated.

As alternative, you can use "prompt" to ask user for their own string.

//Splitting string to characters
kal= kal.split("");

/* --- SPLITTING CHARACTER TO ITS OWN HTML TAG ---
Using Document Object Model, here all characters of string 
is splitted to have their own Html Tag.

Why every character should have its own tag? So they can have their own id,
and also they can have their own position.

After that, we will use DOM to get them by Id, and changing their position, 
when animation is working.

/* --- DEFINING CONSTANT VARIABLES ---
+ "tambah" is how much distance in animation.
+ "derajat" is degree in math.
+ posX is initialization horizontal position.

derajat= 3.1459 / 180; //1 pi radian = 180 derajat
amplitudo= 200; //amplitudo awal
posX= 0;  
sinus(0);


/* --- THE SINE ANIMATION FUNCTION ---
function sinus(alfa) is the method responsible for making sine animation.

The process is simple:

+ First by the time move, it move horizontal position by 5.
  for example if a character was in posX = 0, now it would be it posX = 0 + 5 = 5,
  hence next they will be in = 5 + 5 = 10, and later in = 10 + 5 = 15.

+ Second, by the posX (horizontal position) is moving, we are calculating the vertical 
  position (posY) using this formula:
  
  posY= Math.round(Math.sin(alfa*derajat)*amplitudo)  
  
  this formula is just simply a sine formula.
  
+ Third, you must now that the degree is in 0 - 360.
  so after you reach degree = 360, it will start again at 
  degree = 0. That was what it meant in:

  if (alfa > 360) { alfa= 0; }
  
+ Fourth, now you have had the calculation to get X and Y position. 
  So ho would you apply the animation? 

  Simply using Document Object Model to get the position of each characters,
  using formula: 

  point= document.getElementById(x);

  Then all you need to do is just to apply the position X (horizontal) 
  to left property, and position Y (vertical) to top property. 

And voilaa.. you got a beautiful sine animation.

  if (alfa == 0) { amplitudo= 75 + (Math.random() * 125); } //ubah besar amplitudo secara random tiap 1 siklus sekali
  
  //geser bagian belakang karakter ikuti bagian karakter paling depan
